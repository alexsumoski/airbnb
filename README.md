This is a Clone of the website [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) created with the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework. The goal was to more deeply understanding the framework, specifically in a full-stack context.

### STATUS: WIP

## Vision

Once the project is completed, a live link will appear here.

The main goals are to:
- Created a pixel perfect UI matching Airbnb's website.
- Implement A headless CMS so anyone can update site content with ease.
- Retrieve backend data to populate the application.
- Become more proficient using tailwind.css.

## Plan

My actionable plan will be provided here soon...

## Action & Outcome

The hopeful outcome, to be updated...

This was a good challenge for testing my eye for copying a live site or mockup. I was able to successfully fetch content
from the Prisma CMS, as well all of the locations as seen in the app, including, images, and text are retrieved from MongoDB.
